## Assembly Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Components
1. Remove all support material
2. Sand contact surfaces smooth
3. Test fit all threaded connections
4. Clean parts with isopropyl alcohol

### Step 2: Install Internal Tubing
1. Cut silicone tubing to required lengths:
   - Handle to reservoir: 25cm
   - Reservoir to extension: 20cm
   - Extension internal: 15cm
2. Thread tubing through internal channels
3. Secure with small zip ties at connection points

### Step 3: Assemble Squeeze Mechanism
1. Install small spring in squeeze housing
2. Insert flexible squeeze button (TPU part)
3. Connect to internal tubing with T-connector
4. Test squeeze action for smooth operation

### Step 4: Connect Major Components
1. Screw reservoir onto handle (hand-tight)
2. Insert extension tube into reservoir top
3. Test telescoping action
4. Install locking mechanism

### Step 5: Attach Applicator Head
1. Choose desired applicator head
2. Screw onto extension tube end
3. Test dispensing action
4. Adjust flow rate if needed

### Step 6: Final Testing
1. Fill reservoir with water for testing
2. Test squeeze mechanism
3. Check for leaks at all connections
4. Test extension and locking
5. Verify even dispensing

## Customization Options

### Size Variations
- **Compact Version:** 75% scale for travel
- **Heavy Duty:** 125% scale for larger capacity
- **Kids Version:** 60% scale with safety features

### Color Schemes
- **Medical:** White/blue professional look
- **Fun:** Bright colors for consumer appeal
- **Luxury:** Black/gold premium finish

### Functional Modifications
- Add LED level indicator
- Include temperature sensor
- Integrate Bluetooth for app connectivity
- Add vibration for massage function

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Leaking at Connections:**
- Check O-ring placement
- Apply food-grade sealant
- Ensure proper thread engagement

**Stiff Extension Action:**
- Sand sliding surfaces
- Apply silicone lubricant
- Check for print artifacts

**Weak Squeeze Response:**
- Check spring tension
- Verify tubing connections
- Clean internal channels

**Uneven Dispensing:**
- Clear blocked holes
- Check applicator head alignment
- Adjust internal pressure

## Safety Considerations

### Material Safety
- Use only food-safe materials for parts contacting lotions
- Avoid toxic filaments (ABS with poor ventilation)
- Test materials for skin sensitivity

### Functional Safety
- Ensure smooth operation to prevent injury
- Test extension locking mechanism thoroughly
- Check for sharp edges after printing

## Cost Analysis

### Material Costs
- Filament: $8-12 per unit
- Hardware: $3-5 per unit
- Assembly time: 1-2 hours
- **Total prototype cost: $15-20**

### Commercial Comparison
- Similar products: $25-45 retail
- Manufacturing cost target: $8-12
- Retail price target: $24-35

## Next Steps
